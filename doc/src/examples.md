# Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use `garden` using runnable examples.

## Photo Restoration

The "Photo Restoration" example sets up the
[Bringing Old Photos Back to Life](https://github.com/microsoft/Bringing-Old-Photos-Back-to-Life)
software for restoring old photos that suffer from severe degradation using
machine-learning techniques.

## Git Cola

The "Git Cola" example sets up a development environment for
[Git Cola](https://git-cola.github.io/), a PyQt-based graphical user interface for Git.

[Git Cola's garden.yaml](https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola/blob/main/garden.yaml)
uses garden as a command runner, to keep track of development forks, and to gather
associated trees without the overhead of using submodules.

## Command Interpreters

The "Command Interpreters" example demonstrates how to use a custom interpreter
on a per-command basis.

## Python

The "Python" example demonstrates how to use `python3` to interpret all custom commands.

## Node

The "Node" example demonstrates how to use `node` to interpret all custom commands.
