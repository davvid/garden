# Garden User Guide

## Introduction

Garden streamlines development workflows that involve a loosely-coupled set of
multiple, independent Git trees.

Garden allows you to define dynamic relationships and workflows between these
repositories using a declarative YAML config file that can be shared and used as
a bootstrapping mechanism for getting a auditable, from-source project cloned,
built, installed and running with minimal effort for consumers of a Garden file.

Garden sits above any individual project's build scripts and conventions.
Garden is all about making it easy to remix and reuse libraries maintained
in seperate Git repositories.
